# Raven Forest Fire (Roblox)
Source code for a natural looking forest fire system by me. If editing this for your own project please give me credit and open source the script if possible. Tweak it however you want, if you make something cool then let me know!

This system is a simple starting point for a forest fire, it won't be perfect straight off. 

## Setup
1) Download the `ForestFire.lua` file.
2) Put the `ForestFire.lua` in `ServerStorage`.
3) Create a `Script` in `ServerScriptService`, require the `ForestFire` module and use the `Functions.new` function to create a new forest fire in game.
4) Add the `FireTree` tag to any tree (or model) you want to have a chance of catching fire.

## Bugs
If you find a bug, feel free to create an issue or fix it yourself and create a pull request. Please comment your edits if you fix it and make sure the bug is in this source code and not due to edits you made.

Note: It's not guaranteed that I will fix bugs or edit this in future.
